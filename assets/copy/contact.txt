Contact

The Chicago Recycling Coalition is currently an all volunteer organization, with no staff to regularly check email. We do check our email periodically, but due to the volume of email we receive, we are not able to respond to specific questions about recycling.  



The City of Chicago's recycling information can be found here.  Earth 911's search function is very helpful for specific "how do I recycle this?" questions.



We also suggest visiting our Facebook page, where you can engage other like-minded Chicagoans about recycling issues.
