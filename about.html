            <p>The Chicago Recycling Coalition is a non-profit organization that champions 
              environmentally and fiscally sound management of solid waste through 
              research, education, and advocacy, emphasizing waste reduction, reuse, 
              recycling, composting, and buying recycled.</p>
              
            <p>Back in the early 1980s, the Chicago Recycling Coalition first began as the 
              Coalition for Appropriate Waste Disposal. One of our initial efforts was 
              advocating for a landfill moratorium in Chicago. It was passed by the City 
              Council in 1984 and is still in effect. Another successful campaign was in the 
              mid-nineties, when we worked together with other community groups to 
              shut down Chicago's last municipal waste incinerator. (For more history, see 
              our Chicago Recycling Timeline .</p>
              
            <p>In the early nineties, we also advocated for responsible source-separated 
              municipal recycling programs for the city. The result? An excellent recycling 
              ordinance was passed for commercial buildings and larger apartment 
              complexes. But at the same time, the City Council, under pressure from 
              Mayor Daley, instituted the blue bag program, which asked residents to mix 
              bags of garbage and recycling together in one bin.</p>

            <p>We won that battle. The city began the change to blue cart recycling in May 
              of 2008, and expanded it citywide in 2013.  Now we have the job of ensuring 
              that the blue cart program is functioning as intended, as well as ensuring 
              that buildings with 5 or more units are providing recycling options as they 
              are required to per the "Chicago High Density Residential and Commercial 
              Source Reduction and Recycling Ordinance."
              
              <p>Today we continue to educate and advocate through our newsletter, 
              website, and special events. We're not a huge organization, and all of us are 
              volunteers. But that doesn't keep us from consistently and effectively 
              promoting responsible source-separated recycling and composting for 
              Chicago's residents, businesses, and schools. We encourage you to join us in 
              these efforts!</p>
